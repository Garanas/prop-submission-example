# prop-submission-example
An example of an in-order submission for new custom props.

## Steps
The creative councillor has limited capacity, while at the same time various responsibilities. We expect the submission of props in a specific format to ensure the props can be quickly checked technically, legally and aesthetically. If you deviate from this format we will likely **not** (initially) accept your submission.

If at any time you have questions or doubts on how to proceed you are always welcome to ask questions in the mapping section of the FAF discord. Ping the veteran mappers group when you do so.

### Requirements

For all props it is important the requirements are met. You can find a full description on these requirements here:
 - <todo link to prop requirements document>

These requirements need to be documented. You can do this by making a copy of the following document:
 - https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1GuSAdCxfpK6RoxnJOXvgchcD3TqYuoLeZR_ay3h6SRs/edit?usp=sharing

Navigate to File -> Make a Copy to make a copy to your drive. You need to be logged in a google account in order to make a copy. Make sure to send us a link to your (filled in) copy that is viewable by us. We will make a copy of your copy.

If you do not wish to use Google Drive you can do the following: navigate to File -> Download -> Microsoft Excel (.xlsx) or File -> Download -> Comma-separated values (.csv). Do not forget to append the file to your submission. 

#### General information

 - Cell in map: describes in what cell the props are placed.
 - Theme: describes the theme that the prop should fit in with
 - Name: describes the name of the blueprint file (may be without _prop.bp)

#### Technical requirements

 - Triangles LOD0 / Cutoff: describes the number of triangles in the first level of detail and its cutoff distance.
 - Triangles LOD1 / Cutoff: describes the number of triangles in the second level of detail and its cutoff distance.
 - Triangles LOD2 / Cutoff: describes the number of triangles in the third level of detail and its cutoff distance.

We do not expect you to have more than three LODs. If you have another LOD then you can add in an additional column to the right - but this is not typical.

#### Legal requirements

 - Source albedo: The source of the albedo texture. Can be a link or a short description.
 - Source normals: The source of the normals texture. Can be a link or a short description.
 - Source mesh: The source of the mesh. Can be a link or a short description.
 - Other information: Other relevant sources - this will typically be blank.

### Map template

In order to test the props visually we ask you to place them in a map. Please use the provided template as a base line for this. There is a guide on how to do this, you can find it here:
 - <todo link to guide on making props>

## Checklist

For all props it is important the requirements are met. You can find a full description on these requirements here:
 - <todo link to prop requirements document>

This is a checklist you can use to verify if the submission is complete:
 - [ ] All props are placed in their own cell on the map
 - [ ] All props meet the triangle requirements
 - [ ] All props have the triangle requirements documented
 - [ ] All props meet the texture requirements
 - [ ] All assets have a (short) description of their source

You can 'check' a checkbox by replacing the ' ' with an 'x'.
